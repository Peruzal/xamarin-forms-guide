# Tabbed Navigation

The TabbedPage is used for tabbed navigation. The layout of the a TabbedPage is dependent on the platform. On Android the tabs are displayed at the top and on iOS at the bottom.

On iOS the tabs have a `GetIcon` method that can be overridden to load icons from specified source. On Android tabs have a `SetTabIcon` method that allows loading icons from a custom drawable.

## Create a Tabbed Page in Code

The TabbedPage have a Children property. We can assign child objects to the property to add them to the TabbedPage as follows :

```csharp
public class MainPageCS : TabbedPage
{
  public MainPageCS ()
  {
    var navigationPage = new NavigationPage (new SchedulePageCS ());
    navigationPage.Icon = "schedule.png";
    navigationPage.Title = "Schedule";

    Children.Add (new TodayPageCS ());
    Children.Add (navigationPage);
  }
}
```

## Bottom Navigation tabs on Android

We can show the tabs at the bottom on Android by adding the following code in the class that derives from the tabbed page:

```csharp
On<Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.Android>().SetToolbarPlacement(ToolbarPlacement.Bottom);
```

## Change Colors

The tab bar can be customized for each platform

### iOS

The changes below should be madein the iOS project

- Open the `AppDelegate.cs` file
- Within the method `FinishedLaunching` add the following lines

```cs
public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
{
    // The background color of the tab bar
    UITabBar.Appearance.BarTintColor = UIColor.Orange;
    // Change the tint of the selected image and text
    UITabBar.Appearance.SelectedImageTintColor = UIColor.White;

    global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();
    LoadApplication(new App());

    return base.FinishedLaunching(app, options);
}
```

### Android

On Android you can change the colors in the Android project under the `Resources` -> values - >
